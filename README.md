### Some Important notes:

- Please know that I use python venv while doing this. There might be differences with your installed library. Although this project is straighforward, it should not cause much issue.
- All you need for the dependencies library is in the requirements.txt
- Please note that the youtube video tutorial did not provide you with the dataset. I got similar dataset from: https://github.com/swilliamc/NLP_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
